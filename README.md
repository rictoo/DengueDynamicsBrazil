# Dengue Spatio-Temporal Dynamics in Brazil (2015-2019)

Dengue fever is a significant public health challenge in tropical and subtropical regions. This project studies the spatio-temporal dynamics of dengue fever in Brazil from 2015 to 2019, focusing on its association with various climatic factors.

## Abstract

Dengue fever, a mosquito-borne viral infection, affects many areas, including Brazil. This research investigates dengue incidence across 557 microregions over several years, linking its spread to factors like temperature, the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), and piped water availability. The results will provide a deeper understanding of dengue spread patterns and guide intervention strategies.

Key Findings:
- A positive link exists between minimum temperature and dengue cases.
- Mixed associations were observed for PDSI.
- No direct link was observed between piped water availability and dengue.
- The Goiânia microregion was particularly susceptible to dengue.

## Discussion and Conclusion

### Fixed Effects

- The study indicates the challenge of linear models in showcasing temporal dengue patterns.
- There's a confirmed correlation between increased minimum temperature and dengue incidence.
- Contrasting previous findings, this study only found a mixed connection between PDSI and dengue incidence.
- No strong link exists between water availability percentages and dengue cases.
- Discrepancies in PDSI and temperature interactions were observed compared to other models.

### Random Effects

- Incorporating structured temporal components helped to capture the strong temporal aspect of dengue spread in Brazil.
- A notable decrease in dengue was observed during the 2017-2018 Zika outbreak period.
- Spatial clustering patterns were consistent across all models, with the Goiânia microregion showing the highest cases.
- Different spatio-temporal risks were evident for 2017 and 2019, with a shift in risk areas over the years.
